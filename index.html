    <div id="tvshow"><h1>This is how Star Trek the Orginal Series began:</h1></div>
      <div><p>The original series first aired on September 8th, 1966.  NBC was the
        network where Americans got their first view into Gene Roddenberry's (creator)
        view of space.  He was said to refer to this work as the "Wagon Train in
        to the stars".  The show only lasted 3 years on prime time and ended in 1969.
        However, the show was picked up for syndication, it was an instant hit.  Even
        though the show was supposed to be in the future, it often times addressed
        issues that our current society was and sometimes still experience.  The show
        had themes that addressed racial strife, Utopian societies, facist states, etc.  Sometimes it wasn't until the end of the show did you pick up on the
        parallels to problems we currently see.  William Shatner played Captain Kirk,
        Leonard Nemoy played Science Officer Spock, Deforest Kelly as the ship's Medical officer, James Doohan as the Chief Engineer Scotty, George Takei as
        Sulu, Walter Koenig as Chekov, Nichelle Nicols as the ships communications
        officer.  These characters were definately near and dear to my heart as I
        grew up as a child watching their adventures.  This original series is the basis for 6 original series cast in Movies, 4 Next Generation Movies, and 3 Reboot films as of 2016.  It also spawned 4 TV series (The Next Generation,
        Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise.  CBS is working on a new TV series
        named Star Trek Discovery, available on CBS streaming service.</p>
